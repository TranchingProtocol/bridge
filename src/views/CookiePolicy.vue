        We may also use web beacons in promotional emails and other
        communications with you, to allow us to count how many people read
        them and to verify any clicks through to links within an email. We
        (or our marketing service providers on our behalf) use this to
        help us understand how an email campaign performed, what types of
        emails and content our recipients find interesting, and what
        actions our recipients took, so we can improve our email campaigns
        in the future and make our emails more relevant to our recipients.
        If you do not wish for the web beacon to be downloaded onto your
        device, you should select to receive emails from us in plain text
        rather than HTML.
