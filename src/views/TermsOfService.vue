        zkAmoeba and the suite of open-source code underlying it are
        contributed, used, and supported by a wide variety of
        participants. ZKAmoeba is one of these many participants and

        development of the zkAmoeba ecosystem, ZKAmoeba currently operates
        the Sites. ZKAmoeba expects to transition the maintenance and
        operation of the Sites to one or more separate entities that are

                    fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a

                    the remaining filing and arbitrator fees for the
                    arbitration, provided your claim does not exceed
                    $75,000. For claims above $75,000, fees and costs will
                    be determined in accordance with applicable JAMS
                    rules. The arbitration rules permit you to recover
                    attorney’s fees in certain cases. You may choose to
                    have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on
                    written submissions, or in person in the country where
                    you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any
                    judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may
                    be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any
                    arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either
                    party must contain sufficient information to provide
                    fair notice to the other party of the asserting
                    party’s identity, the claims being asserted, and the
                    factual allegations on which they are based. The
                    arbitrator or JAMS may require amendment of any demand
                    or counterclaim that does not satisfy these
                    requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose
                    sanctions in accordance with JAMS Rule 24 for any
                    claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or
                    improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule
                    of Civil Procedure 11). The parties agree that JAMS
                    has discretion to modify the amount or timing of any
                    administrative or arbitration fees due under JAMS’s
                    Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such
                    modification does not increase the costs to you, and
                    you waive any objection to such fee modification. The
                    parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by
                    either party to the fees imposed by JAMS does not
                    constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this
                    Arbitration Agreement while such challenge remains
                    pending before JAMS, the arbitrator, or a court of
                    competent jurisdiction.</span>

                  Authority of arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have
                  exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and
                  enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, and (ii)
                  resolve any dispute related to the interpretation,
                  applicability, enforceability or formation of this
                  Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any
                  assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration
                  Agreement is void or voidable, whether a claim is
                  subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the
                  payment of JAMS administrative or arbitrator fees
                  (including the timing of such payments and remedies for
                  nonpayment). The arbitrator will decide the rights and
                  liabilities, if any, of you and us. The arbitration
                  proceeding will not be consolidated with any other
                  matters or joined with any other cases or parties,
                  provided that the arbitrator shall also be empowered to
                  consolidate claims raised between the same parties to a
                  single arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator shall have
                  the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or
                  part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the
                  authority to award monetary damages and to grant any
                  non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual
                  under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and
                  this Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).
                  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement
                  of decision describing the essential findings and
                  conclusions on which the award is based, including the
                  calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has
                  the same authority to award relief on an individual
                  basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The
                  award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you
                  and us. No arbitration award or decision will have any
                  preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute
                  with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.

                  Waiver of jury trial. YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY
                  CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND
                  HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and we
                  are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or
                  requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration
                  under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in
                  Section 13a (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement)
                  above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis
                  the same damages and relief as a court and must follow
                  this Arbitration Agreement as a court would. However,
                  there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court
                  review of an arbitration award is subject to very
                  limited review.

                  Waiver of class or other non-individualized relief. ALL
                  DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE
                  SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED
                  ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE
                  BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS
                  OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR
                  CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER. If a decision
                  is issued stating that applicable law precludes
                  enforcement of any of this section’s limitations as to a
                  given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such
                  aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought
                  into the courts of the Cayman Island. All other
                  disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be
                  arbitrated.

            Governing Law. hese Terms are governed by and will be
            construed under the laws of the Cayman Islands, excluding its
            body of law controlling conflict of laws. You agree that the
            Sites shall be deemed to be based solely in the Cayman
            Islands, and that although the Sites may be available in other
            jurisdictions, its availability does not give rise to general
            or specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside the
            Cayman Islands. Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this
            Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
            You agree that any judicial proceeding will be brought in the
            courts located in the Cayman Islands.

            Conflict of Provisions. In the event that there exists a

            Compliance with Law. You represent and warrant that you will
            comply with all laws that apply to you, your use of the
            Interface, and your actions and omissions that relate to the
            Interface. If your use of the Interface is prohibited by
            applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the
            Interface. We will not be responsible for your using the
            Interface in a way that is a violation of any law. Without
            limiting the foregoing, you represent and warrant that you are
            not, and for the duration of the time you use the Interface
            will not be (a) the subject of economic or trade sanctions
            administered or enforced by any governmental authority or
            otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted
            parties (including but not limited to the United Nations

          <li>
            Interface vs. Protocol. The Interface facilitates your ability
            to access zkAmoeba, a layer 2 rollup protocol on the Filecoin
            blockchain (the “Protocol”). The Interface is distinct from
            the Protocol. It provides one, but not the exclusive, means of
            accessing the Protocol. The Protocol is public,
            permissionless, and runs on open-source self-executing smart
            contracts. The Protocol enables people to do various things,
            such as processing Filecoin transactions more efficiently and
            interacting with smart contract-based applications (“dApps”).
            The Interface, on the other hand, enables you to initiate
            messages to the Protocol to bridge digital assets between the
            Filecoin and zkAmoeba public blockchains.
          </li>
          <li>
            Accessing the Interface. To access the Interface you must use
            non-custodial wallet software (a “Web3 wallet”), which
            constructs and broadcasts the data (“transactions”) that
            allows you to interact with the Protocol. By using your Web3
            wallet in connection with accessing the Interface, you agree
            that you are using the Web3 wallet under the terms and
            conditions of the applicable provider of the Web3 wallet. No
            Web3 wallet is created by, operated by, maintained by, or
            affiliated with us. Accordingly, we do not have custody or
            control over the contents of your Web3 wallet and we have no
            ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. Your
            relationship with any given Web3 wallet provider is governed
            by the applicable terms of service of that third party, not
            the Interface Terms.

                represent that you are sophisticated enough to understand
                the various inherent risks of using cryptographic and
                public blockchain-based systems, including but not limited

                implicitly) regarding, and that you will not hold us
                liable for those risks, including but not limited to the
                risks described below, any or all of which could lead to
                losses and damages, including the total and irrevocable
                loss of your assets. These risks include, but are not

                  responsible for the safeguarding and security of your
                  Web3 wallets. If you lose your wallet seed phrase,
                  private keys, or password, you may be forever unable to
                  access your digital assets. Any unauthorized access to
                  your wallet by third parties could result in the loss or
                  theft of your digital assets. We have no involvement in,

                  Blockchain technology. Public blockchains, and the
                  technology underlying and interacting with cryptographic
                  and public blockchain-based systems, are experimental,
                  inherently risky, and subject to change. Among other
                  risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattacks, or changes to a
                  particular public blockchain (e.g., via forks) could
                  disrupt these technologies irreparably. There is no
                  guarantee that any of these technologies will not become
                  unavailable, degraded, or subject to hardware or
                  software errors, operational or technical difficulties,
                  denial-of-service attacks, other cyberattacks, or other
                  problems requiring maintenance, interruptions, delays,
                  or errors.

                  Network cost and performance. The cost, speed, and
                  availability of transacting on public blockchain systems
                  are subject to significant variability. There is no
                  guarantee that any transfer will be confirmed or
                  transferred successfully.

                  Blockchain transactions and smart contract execution.
                  Public blockchain-based transactions (including but not
                  limited to transactions automatically executed by smart
                  contracts) are generally considered irreversible when
                  confirmed. Any transaction that will interact with smart
                  contracts or be recorded on a public blockchain must be
                  recorded with extreme caution.

                  nascent and highly volatile due to various risk factors
                  including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation,
                  technology, security, and regulation. Digital assets and
                  their underlying blockchain networks are complex
                  emerging technologies that may be subject to delays,
                  halts or go offline as a result of errors, forks,
                  attacks or other unforeseeable reasons. Anyone can
                  create a digital asset, including fake versions of
                  existing digital assets and digital assets that falsely
                  claim to represent projects. So-called stablecoins may
                  not be as stable as they purport to be, may not be fully
                  or adequately collateralized, and may be subject to
                  panics and runs. You are solely responsible for
                  understanding the risks specific to each digital asset
                  that is relevant to you.

                  Bridging. In addition to being an especially novel and
                  untested implementation of blockchain technology in
                  general, cross-blockchain bridging technology has
                  historically been, and may in the future be, the subject
                  of numerous cyberattacks and exploits, including without
                  limitation, hacks that exploit a vulnerability in the
                  associated software, hardware, systems or other
                  equipment or social engineering to gain control of the
                  any bridge components, wallets, smart contracts or other
                  related systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Control of the Protocol. The Protocol is subject to
                  periodic upgrades, which may introduce other risks,
                  bugs, malfunctions, cyberattack vectors, or other
                  changes to the Protocol that could disrupt the operation
                  of the Interface, the functionality of bridging, your
                  ability to access bridged digital assets, or otherwise
                  cause you damage or loss.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Third Party Risks. hird-party products carry their own
                  individual, oftentimes highly significant risks. When
                  you use the Interface to interact with any third-party
                  products, you are subject to all of those risks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Legislative and regulatory risks. Legislative and
                  regulatory risks. Digital assets, blockchain technology,
                  and any related software and services are subject to
                  legal and regulatory uncertainty in many jurisdictions.
                  Legislative and regulatory changes or actions may
                  adversely affect the usage, transferability,
                  transactability and accessibility of digital assets,
                  bridging, the Protocol, or the Interface.
